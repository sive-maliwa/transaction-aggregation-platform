\# Transaction Aggregation Platform



A Spring Boot–based microservices platform for ingesting, persisting, and aggregating financial transactions.



This project demonstrates a \*\*production-style backend architecture\*\* using:

\- Spring Boot 3

\- PostgreSQL

\- Docker \& Docker Compose

\- Maven multi-module setup



---



\## 🏗 Architecture Overview



The system consists of the following services:



\### 🔹 Ingestion API

\- Accepts incoming transaction data

\- Persists transactions to PostgreSQL

\- Runs on port \*\*8080\*\*



\### 🔹 Aggregator API

\- Aggregates persisted transaction data

\- Exposes read-only aggregation endpoints

\- Runs on port \*\*8081\*\*



\### 🔹 PostgreSQL

\- Shared database used by both services

\- Containerized using official PostgreSQL image

\- Java \*\*17+\*\*

\- Maven \*\*3.9+\*\*

\- Docker \& Docker Compose

\## 🚀 Build \& Run (Docker)



\### 1️⃣ Build the project



From the root directory:



```bash

mvn clean package



2️⃣ Build and start all services

docker-compose up --build





This will start:



PostgreSQL



Ingestion API → http://localhost:8080



Aggregator API → http://localhost:8081





🧪 Running Tests



To run all unit tests:



mvn test





To run tests for a specific module:



cd ingestion-api

mvn test





🩺 Health Checks



Both APIs expose Spring Boot Actuator endpoints:



Ingestion API

http://localhost:8080/actuator/health



Aggregator API

http://localhost:8081/actuator/health





🐳 Docker Notes



Each API has its own Dockerfile



Docker Compose handles:



Service startup



Network configuration



Database connectivity



🧠 Design Considerations



Clean separation between API and business logic layers



Shared persistence module to avoid duplication



Production-grade configuration structure



Container-first deployment approach
